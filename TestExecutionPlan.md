# Test Execution and Framework Enhancement Plan

## Test Execution Requirements

- Run all tests 3 times.
- Record pass/fail results for each run.
- Acceptance Criteria: At least 2 out of 3 runs must pass on the same OS/browser.

## Task 5: Backlog/Future Items

### Possible Enhancements
- Integrate database setup for test environments.
- Add API testing module to the framework.
- Dockerize the framework for easier deployment and environment consistency.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement automated test execution and result recording.
2. Validate acceptance criteria after test runs.
3. Plan and prioritize future enhancements.
